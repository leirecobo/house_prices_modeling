# Housing Price Prediction

Welcome to our Housing Price Prediction project repository! In this project, we aim to construct a predictive model for the sale price of houses in Ames, Iowa. The real estate market is dynamic, and accurately predicting housing prices is crucial. This report delves into the task of developing a model that can effectively predict the selling price of residential homes, providing valuable insights into the pricing dynamics of this market.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:

- Developing an effective price prediction model for residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
- Identifying key attributes that influence housing prices.
- Providing insights to management to understand the pricing dynamics of the housing market.
- Rigorously validating the predictive accuracy of the model.

## Dataset

The dataset provided contains the characteristics of 1460 residential homes in Ames, Iowa, as well as their sale price. These characteristics offer a comprehensive insight into various aspects of houses, including:

- Physical details such as lot frontage (LotFrontage) and lot area (LotArea).
- Structural aspects such as building class (MSSubClass) and overall quality of material and finish (OverallQual).
- Environmental and location-related aspects such as general zoning classification (MSZoning) and proximity to roads or railroads (Condition1, Condition2).
- Construction-related variables including the presence and quality of masonry veneers (MasVnrType, MasVnrArea) and details about the basement (BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure).

## Methodology

The model-building process will encompass various steps, including:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships of features.
2. Feature engineering to create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.
3. Model selection, where we'll explore different regression techniques to find the best-performing model.
4. Model evaluation using appropriate metrics to assess predictive accuracy.
5. Fine-tuning and optimization of the chosen model to improve performance further.
